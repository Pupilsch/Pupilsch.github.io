There are three columns.</span></p><p>It’s a monthly multiple time series from 1950 to 2000. “Price” : Average producer price for frozen orange juice. “ppi” : Producer price index for finished goods. Used to deflate the overall producer price index for finished goods to eliminate the effects of overall price inflation. “fdd” : Number of freezing degree days at the Orlando, Florida, airport. Calculated as the sum of the number of degrees Fahrenheit that the minimum temperature falls below freezing in a given day over all days in the month.</p><p>I’m using this plot to show that the producer price’s link with the final price of the jucie. It’s obvious that in general the higher the producer price is, higher the juice price. But the fronze day in this area will have a effect on the price of producer since the outcome is reduced. So I used a color buttonm to indicates these circumsdances. That’s why I use circle mark since the mark is too crowded to be shown by other marks.</p></div></div></div></div>
